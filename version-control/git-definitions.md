# Git Definitions
## With Changes!

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 
Version control makes record of changes to files as you work on a project, so that you may roll back to prior versions at a later time.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch holds changes being made to a project, keeping the updated information separate from your codebase. You would use a branch to make sure that your new code is able to be reviewed before being added to the codebase, avoiding bugs/issues with your working code.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit officially records changes made to the repository. A good commit message is meaningful, and others who may need to use/view your work in the future would be able to understand what was done in this segment of work. 


* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when there is a difference in the information in your branches because you or someone else working on the project has made changes that do not line up properly, ie. editing the README file in both your master branch and new-feature branch, with a line or lines of text missing from the new-feature branch version.
